# Paytm Labs Technical Challenge by Nisanthan Nanthakumar

This is a web-based clone of the Signup and Login screens using React

## Viewing the Site Locally

The site can be built with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). If you have Node.js installed on your system, you can run the following commands to build and serve a local copy.

```sh
# Clone the git repository and cd into the cloned directory.
git clone https://github.com/NisanthanNanthakumar/paytm-clone.git
cd client

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Build and serve the site at http://localhost:3000
npm start
```

This starts up a local server on port 3000. To view the site in your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Go to [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) to view the Login Screen.

Go to [http://localhost:3000/signup](http://localhost:3000/signup) to view the Signup Screen.
